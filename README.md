Title: Spring Boot Project: CRUD Operations with Hibernate and MySQL

Summary:
This Spring Boot project is designed to demonstrate the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 
using Hibernate as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework and MySQL as the database.

The project leverages the power of Spring Boot, an opinionated framework that simplifies the development of Java applications. 
It provides a robust and efficient platform for building enterprise-grade applications with ease.

By integrating Hibernate, a popular ORM framework, the project enables seamless mapping between Java objects and relational database tables.
Hibernate simplifies data persistence and retrieval by automatically generating SQL queries based on annotated entity classes,
making it easier to perform CRUD operations.

MySQL, a widely used open-source relational database management system, 
is employed as the underlying database for data storage and retrieval. 
It offers scalability, reliability, and a rich set of features, making it an excellent choice for this project.

The project showcases the implementation of basic CRUD functionality, 
allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete records in the MySQL database using a RESTful API. 
It provides endpoints for performing these operations, which can be accessed via HTTP requests.

The Spring Boot project is structured in a modular manner, 
following best practices and design patterns. 
It promotes code reusability, maintainability, and extensibility, making it a solid foundation for future enhancements and scalability.

In summary, this Spring Boot project with Hibernate and MySQL demonstrates the implementation of CRUD operations,
providing developers with a practical example of building a robust and efficient RESTful API with database integration.
